Pretty much if you know how to write an equation for a sinusoidal function you already know like 80% of the test. The rest is just graphing using mapping rule or 5 point method and word problems. There were some speed questions that I guess I missed how to do last week but you can logically figure them out easily. S=d/t, just plug in numbers and reduce and you get the answer. The first half of the thinking question screwed me over and it was the only thing I got wrong. You found the equation for a Ferris wheel in a previous question and then you had to find for how long the people were above a certain height. The second part of the thinking question was literally free marks where you had to graph sin^2(x) and describe domain and range. Overall, just make sure your equation writing skillz are good"
Helios(263464849298817034): 2017-05-19 T18:06:49.719Z: "Just a recap, first page is just equation writing, second page is mapping and then communication questions like, what are examples of periodic functions and what c value do you need to plug in to an equation to get rid of x intercepts (it's just one more than amplitude) then it's a question where some dude has two DJ disks that spin at different speeds. You have to find their speeds and tell which one is faster. Then another equation writing equation then a Ferris wheel question (just do some in textbook) and then thinking question 1 where you have to find for how long some dudes where above a certain height during the Ferris wheel ride and then thinking question 2 is the ez shit I told you before."
Helios(263464849298817034): 2017-05-19 T18:15:50.339Z: "Also it helps that you can just check your equations after by plugging in values from that function"
